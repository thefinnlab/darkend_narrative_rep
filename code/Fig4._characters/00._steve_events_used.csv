28,"ÊLucy, I don't mean to be contrary, but I have been to other locations of Bridal Innovations, and they have all had bottles of water and energy bars under the counter for customers.",,1.0,132.14,142.38,134,144,10
36,"ÊOh, shut up. Shut up, you fucking robot. Shut up, you fucking worthless corporate drone.Ê",,1.0,173.54,178.72,175,180,5
38,"ÊNo, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Lucy. It's been a crazy day, like you said. Shopping for a wedding dress. I've been to all these locations. So much stress. My blood sugar is just, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Lucy.Ê",,1.0,184.6,202.28,186,204,18
40,"Yes, yes, she is on the way. Well, no, she's not on the way. She's not on the way.Ê",,1.0,212.22,219.36,214,221,7
41,"No. Lucy, there's something I need to tell you, actually.ÊAnd this is a little embarrassing for me. OK. The wedding dress is for me.Ê",,1.0,219.76,231.96,221,233,12
61,"OK, that's fine. That's fine. Look, I will just sit here and wait for security.",,1.0,369.44,374.68,371,376,5
69,"It's just, I'm so thirsty. And all of this is, you don't get it.Ê",,1.0,410.26,417.18,412,419,7
75,"Oh, my gosh. Lucy, thank you so much. Oh. Lucy, you're one of the good ones, Lucy. Oh, thank you. I'm sorry I didn't earlier.Ê",,1.0,436.82,449.9,438,451,13
78,"Hey, you know what? Look, you're busy. What if we just forget this whole thing happened and you let me go?Ê",,1.0,456.74,465.02,458,467,9
80,ÊRight. It's policy. But what if they don't show up?,,1.0,470.68,478.88,472,480,8
82,What if they don't? Would you make me stay here until I die of thirst and I'm a rotting corpse on your nice bench?Ê,,1.0,480.9,487.72,482,489,7
84,"ÊRight. OK. Lucy, I'm thinking of telling you a story while we're waiting for security.Ê",,1.0,497.94,507.68,499,509,10
86,"What? No, no. It's not that. It's a short story. And it's funny, but it's also a dangerous story.",,1.0,510.9,518.0,512,520,8
94,OK. Let's try it. So this story takes place 100 years in the future.,,1.0,539.56,545.52,541,547,6
98,"I bet he does, Lucy. Beautiful girl like you. He's very lucky to have you. OK, so what year would it be 100 years from now?Ê",,1.0,556.32,564.06,558,566,8
100,"That's great. 2057. Close enough. Now, one thing about the 2050s is there's this weird nostalgia they have for the 1950s. It kind of reminds people of a simpler time. It's a gimmick. So they'll have, for example, 1950s diners, or in this case, in my story, wedding dress stores with a 1950s theme.",,1.0,567.8,586.52,569,588,19
104,"And they have robots in the store, because robots do most of the retail now. They're cheaper, and they can be more charming, but also strong. So if there's a shoplifter, they can really handle it.",,1.0,592.62,601.88,594,603,9
106,"Right, that's another thing. So these robots have fake backstories to add a little charm. They might have a boyfriend, or they're excited about a sock hop, or a game, or something. And of course, the boyfriends aren't real, but you can hear the robots on the phone having fake conversations just to add to the realism. Does that make sense to you?Ê",,1.0,608.38,625.94,610,627,17
109,"OK, these robots have brains that are programmed to do their thing. They're specialized. Corporations are too cheap to put a full intelligence in a sales robot. But if there's an emergency, like if there's a fire, they're required by law to switch over to emergency mode, help put out the fire. But sometimes they break, and something is wrong, and they won't switch over. So they're stuck in their kind of-Ê",,1.0,631.44,652.6,633,654,21
111,"Yes, sales mode. Exactly. You get it. Good. Now let's say there's a really big emergency, bigger than a fire, the end of the world. There was a war and a giant disaster involving nanotechnology.",,1.0,654.9,669.06,656,671,15
113,Microscopic bugs. And they change things. They change people. And it killed or changed most of the people in the world.,,1.0,671.18,680.04,673,682,9
115,"Yeah, bear with me. OK, so there's this guy, someone like me. He's trying to survive, eat, avoid predators. And he figures out that wedding dress stores have clean drinks and snacks hidden behind the counter to keep customers happy. This is his survival advantage. People don't think to loot a wedding dress store. So he goes from one to another, town to town, and that helps him live.",,1.0,682.06,707.5,684,709,25
117,"Yes, yes. Now, most of the stores have no robots, because they went into emergency mode and left to try and help people and eventually ran out of their battery. But one, for whatever reason, didn't switch into that mode. She kept running her store. There's a solar charger in the back she uses to recharge a closing. But in her mind, she's going out with her boyfriend or whatever, and this goes on for years.",,1.0,709.56,732.94,711,734,23
118,"But there's no one to stop her. She just keeps working. And she sees weird things that she wasn't programmed for. So say if there's a car crashed into the food court and human bones there, she calls it remodeling. She takes what she sees and tries to understand it in terms of her sales mode brain. Do you understand?",,1.0,733.64,750.98,735,752,17
119,"ÊYes. Like, there's an emergency alarm playing on a loop. It says emergency over and over. But she doesn't have that mode, so she just makes it into a song. Do you hear it?Ê",,1.0,752.1,764.18,754,766,12
131,"ÊOoh. Yeah. But the story isn't over, Lucy. You haven't heard the ending yet. And you are going to have to help me write it.Ê",,1.0,801.64,811.04,803,813,10
133,"But listen, if you were the man trapped in this store with this robot and you were going to die waiting for a security that would never come, what would you do to persuade her to let you go? And maybe even give you all the water and energy bars?",,1.0,812.8,824.8,814,826,12
138,"No. No, but they do have a plug. Oh, a plug, like a wall plug. Yes, exactly. Right under their right armpit. Oh, gross. And if you press it, it will tell you the battery life remaining.Ê",,1.0,842.18,851.1,844,853,9
140,"Here's a funny idea, Lucy. Why don't you feel and see if you have one under your armpit?Ê",,1.0,852.9,857.08,854,859,5
165,"ÊOh, good. Thank god he's leaving. Maybe it's a good thing that you detained me here, Lucy.Ê",,1.0,938.98,943.46,940,945,5
174,"Lucy, listen to me. This is a new subroutine. Your closing subroutine. You've got to listen to me. That thing will kill me.",,1.0,964.7,970.84,966,972,6
178,"Lucy, let go of me, please. What kind of dog is green? Look at that. It's the fluorescent lighting. Look at that face. That is a human face.Ê",,1.0,976.54,983.3,978,985,7
184,"No, look, I just remembered. I can't buy the dress tomorrow. We are flying to Italy tomorrow morning, so you have to stay open. Your policy has to include staying open for a big sale, right? Wouldn't it?",,1.0,995.62,1005.3,997,1007,10
